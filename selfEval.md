# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm most proud of when something finally clicked and I got the result I wanted from my console, the satisfaction I felt was encouraging. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions are powerful because they can be used multiple times to achieve whatever goal they were made for, not just the one time. It's sustainable, in a way.
